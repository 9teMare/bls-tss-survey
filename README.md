# TSS: Threshold Signature Scheme library

### Repository structure:

- `disc`: Contains the discovery and synchronization module. Its role is to bootstrap the membership of the parties that are about to sign a message.

- `mpc`: Contains implementations of various threshold signature schemes. Currently the only available one is the Binance ECDSA TSS scheme. 

- `net`: Contains an implementation of a network module. Its role is to provide end to end encrypted and authenticated communication.

- `rbc`: Implements reliable byzantine fault tolerant broadcast. Its role is to ensure parties do not equivocate when broadcasting messages.

- `testutil`: Contains utilities used in tests, mostly TLS key generation.

- `test`: Contains integration tests that instantiate the TSS library with various threshold signature schemes found in `mpc`.

- `threshold`: Contains the TSS library, which orchestrates instances of `disc`, `mpc`, `rbc` and optionally `net`.

- `types`: Contains interface and type declaration.


### Go Module structure: 

The repository contains different go modules:

- `tss`: The main module of the library, receives threshold signature schemes as a dependency injection.
- `mpc/binance`: Wraps around the threshold signature scheme of binance-chain and presents an API that `tss` understands.
- `test`: Contains integration tests that instantiate `tss` with all implementations in `mpc` (currently only `mpc/binance`)

The `test` module imports both `tss` and `mpc/binance` but neither `tss` nor `mpc/binance` do not import one another. 


## Using the library

Each node that may participate in the threshold key generation phase or in the threshold signature phase must instantiate an instance of `threshold.Scheme`.
The instance can be obtained either by *explicitly* instantiating it and filling out its various public fields:

```
s := &threshold.Scheme{
   RBF: ...
   SyncFactory: ...
   ...
}
```

or alternatively by using the default construction method: `threshold.DefaultScheme(...)`.

By initializing the `threshold.Scheme` instance explicitly, it is possible to pass different implementations of its underlying dependencies (`rbc`, `disc`, etc.).

It is the responsibility of the consumer to ensure that messages that arrive to the party
are dispatched by the `threshold.Scheme` instance by calling `HandleMessage(msg *IncMessage)`.
The `IncMessage` struct appears below, and it is also the responsibility of the consumer to provide a secure, secret, and authenticated communication layer. 

```
type IncMessage struct {
	Data    []byte
	Source  uint16
	MsgType uint8
	Topic   []byte
}

```

#### What are universal identifiers and party identifiers? 

In a decentralized setting, two or more nodes may belong to the same company, institution, or just be administered by the same entities.


One of the dependencies of the `threshold.Scheme` is a function that returns the membership:

```
func() map[UniversalID]PartyID
```

A `UniversalID` uniquely defines a node within a network. The library expects that nodes with different universal identifiers will have different endpoints, or even be different hosts.

On the other hand, a `PartyID` is a unique identifier of *one or more* universal identifiers that belong to the same organization.
In every occurrence of a threshold protocol (either a key generation or a signature), each universal identifier may only correspond to a unique party identifier.
See the following example for motivation and clarity:


Consider a scenario where we have a threshold key that is secret shared across three different companies: `A`, `B`, `C`. 
Each company runs a node and has its own universal identifier, and it receives a single (secret) share of the private key.
Next, company `A` decides to replicate its secret share across three servers for high availability and load balancing.
Since company `A` now has several servers, but only one server at a time may participate in signing (or key generation), 
the library needs to distinguish the servers by their identifiers. 

However, in order for the `mpc` module to be simple, it shouldn't be aware of the fact that several identifiers may correspond to the same party.
To that end, the `mpc` module uses `PartyID` for its membership, and the rest of the modules (`rbc`, `disc`) use `UniversalID`. 
The `threshold` package performs translation between the two spaces in a way that is transparent to the `mpc` module. 

Note: Since the `mpc` module is pluggable and decoupled from this library, it does not reference the library. 
As a result, its API uses `uint16` instead of `PartyID`: 

```
Init(parties []uint16, threshold int, sendMsg func(msg []byte, isBroadcast bool, to uint16))

OnMsg(msgBytes []byte, from uint16, broadcast bool)
```

#### Generating a threshold public key

Before signing, the threshold public key needs to be generated by having the `threshold.Scheme` instance in each party invoke:

The `totalParties` is the number of shares this key needs to be split into, and `threshold` is the lowest number of shares
for which reconstruction of the secret is not possible.

```
secretData, err := KeyGen(ctx context.Context, totalParties, threshold int) ([]byte, error)
```

Then, the returned byte slice `secretData` needs to be stored in a secure and reliable place. 


#### Signing a message

After generating a public key, the `threshold.Scheme` instance needs to be initialized with the secret data.
To do that, simply assign the `StoredData` field:

```
// Initialize the instance, either explicitly, or using the default constructor as below
s := threshold.DefaultScheme(...)
// Assign the secret data returned from KeyGen()
s.StoredData = secretData
```

Then, two operations are available:

- `ThresholdPK() ([]byte, error)`: Returns the serialized threshold public key, encoded by the `mpc` dependency injected.

- `Sign(c context.Context, msg []byte, topic string) ([]byte, error)`: Signs `msg` in the context of given `topic`. Returns the signature encoded by the `mpc` dependency injected. 
To avoid denial of service by malicious parties that haven't received `msg`, `topic` must be unpredictable.
